    <h1> Odin's Recipes</h1>

    <p> As Odin decreed, we shall develop this site and introduce it to our glorious ways. Let us begin with our food, specially prepared to bring forth your inner fire. From now on these recipes are to be present at every household! Glory to Odin!</p>
       
    <p> Lets begin with the three basic elements of <strong> Valhallan Cuisine </strong>: <em> Beer, Bread, and Meat.</em> By Decree of the All Father, no warrior will go without these. </p>
        
    <p> For our first dish, we will be creating a <strong> Valhallan Specialty </strong>, <em> one of Thor Odinson's favorites! </em></p>

    <p> For our second dish, we have a delicious dip. This one is great for sharing, make sure to let the whole family know so no one pulls a Loki on you out of jealousy, for missing out on such a treat!</p>

                <h1> By Decree of the All-Father </h1>
                <p> As we conquer & develop this site, in the name of Odin, we shall introduce those here to our culture, and our ways. We shall begin with nutrition, <strong> Valhallan Cuisine</strong> is specially prepared to bring forth your inner fire. From now on these recipes are to be present at every household! Glory to Odin!</p>
                <p> Lets begin with the three basic elements of <strong> Valhallan Cuisine </strong>: <em> Beer, Bread, and Meat.</em> By Decree of the All Father, no warrior will go without these. Freya has been kind enough to share some of her recipes, keep an eye out for them!</p>
                <p> For our first dish, we will be creating a <strong> Valhallan Specialty </strong>, <em> one of Thor Odinson's favorites! </em></p>
                <p> For our second dish, we have a delicious dip. This one is great for sharing, make sure to let the whole family know so no one pulls a Loki on you out of jealousy, for missing out on such a treat!</p>    
                <p> The rest of the dishes will be updated shortly, I did not invite Loki to the taste-testing and he has hidden my recipe book! Curses! </p>

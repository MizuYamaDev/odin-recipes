        <h2> Grilled Steak with a simple beer marinade! </h2>
            <p> As the All-Father commands, all our warriors will feast with beer as an ingredient in every dish! Honor him, follow this recipe: </p>

            <ul> 
                <li> 4 Pounds of the <strong> Valhallan Wagyu </strong> </li>
                <li> 3 tablespoons of salt </li>
                <li> 4 tablespoons of lemmon pepper </li>
                <li> 2 Bottles of the finest mead in Valhalla, either <strong> Thor's Special Homebrew</strong> or <strong> Loki's Pale Ale </strong></li>    
            </ul>
    
            <h5> Step 1 </h5>
                <p> Season your Valhallan Wagyu with the salt and lemon pepper. Don't hold back on the seasoning, or you risk invoking Thor's Wrath! </p>
            <h5> Step 2 </h5>
                <p> Place your Valhallan Wagyu in a large, shallow container with a lid. Gently pour your <strong> Valhallan Ale </strong> of choice, with care not too wash off the seasoning thus invoking Loki's laughter, don't give him the oportunity to question your chef skills. </p>
            <h5> Step 3 </h5>
                <p> Pre-heat the grill, or ask Thor to ready Mjollnir. </p>
            <h5> Step 4 </h5>
                <p> Place steaks on the grill, for 5 mins each side, or to the desired doneness. If Thor did fire up Mjollnir, 1 smack per side of the steak should have you at medium rare. 2 blows for medium, and with 3 it's ruined. Discard of the marinade. </p>

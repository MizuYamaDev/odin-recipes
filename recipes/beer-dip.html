        <h2> Grilled Steak with a simple beer marinade! </h2>
            <p> As the All-Father commands, no pretzel will be eaten without Beer Dip! Honor him, follow this recipe: </p>

            <ul> 
                <li> 2 Tablespoons of unsalted butter. </li>
                <li> 2 tablespoons of flour. </li>
                <li> 1 Teaspoon of garlic powder. </li>
                <li> 1 Teaspoon of dried parsley. </li>
                <li> 1/2 Teaspoon of kosher salk. </li> 
                <li> 1/2 tablespoons of black pepper. </li>
                <li> 2 Cup of the finest mead in Valhalla, either <strong> Thor's Special Homebrew</strong> or <strong> Loki's Pale Ale </strong>.</li>    
                <li> 8 oz Cheddar Cheese, Grated.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h5> Step 1 </h5>
                <p> First, add butter and flour to a medium pot over medium heat. While it melts add garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper, and wisk/cook for 2 minutes.</p> 
            <h5> Step 2 </h5>
                <p> Take one of your 2 cups of your <strong> Valhallan Ale </strong> of choice, and chug it. Don't hold back on the lager, or you risk invoking Thor's Wrath! </p>  
            <h5> Step 3 </h5>
                <p> Take the other cup of your <strong> Valhallan Ale </strong> of choice, and slowly whisk it into the roux until it thickens. It should have a gravy like consistency, if it is too thick add more lager. Loki will judge you if its too thick. </p>
            <h5> Step 5 </h5>
                <p> Add the Grated cheese, and whisk until it melts. Once it does, serve immediately. </p>
